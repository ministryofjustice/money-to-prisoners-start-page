          <h2 id="letters">Letters</h2>

          <p>You can contact a prisoner by writing to them. Write the person’s prisoner number on the envelope. Normally there’s no limit on the number of letters you can send.</p>

          <p>Most letters sent to and from prison are checked by prison staff.</p>

          <p>Prisons cannot open letters from solicitors and courts except in special cases, for example if they suspect a letter is not really from a legal adviser.</p>

          <p>You can <a href="#">complain to the prison</a> if you think your letters are being read when they should not be, or if your letters are not reaching the prisoner.</p>

          <h2 id="video-calls">Video calls</h2>

          <p>You can make secure video calls to people in some prisons using your mobile phone or tablet.</p>

          <p>Calls can last up to 30 minutes. A prisoner is allowed 1 free video call a month.</p>

          <h3 id="who-can-call">Who can call</h3>

          <p>You must be over 18 and on the prisoner’s list of friends and family.</p>

          <p>You can invite up to 3 other people (of any age) on the call if they are on the prisoner’s visitor list.</p>

          <h3 id="how-to-call">How to call</h3>

          <ol class="steps">
            <li>
              <p>Find out <a href="#">if the prison offers video calls</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="#">Install an app on your phone or tablet</a> (it can take up to 24 hours for your account on the app to be verified).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Check if everyone who wants to join the call is on the prisoner’s list of friends and family.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Request a video call using the app or ask the prisoner to request a call.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prison staff will schedule the call and send confirmation by email.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>All video calls are recorded. Prison staff may watch video calls while they are happening.</p>

          <h2 id="telephone-calls">Telephone calls</h2>

          <p>The prisoner has to call you using a prison phone.</p>

          <p>They can only call people named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they’re able to call.</p>

          <p>Prison staff can listen to and record most types of call. Some calls are not monitored, for example when a prisoner calls a legal adviser.</p>

          <p>You can also exchange voice messages with a prisoner using the <a rel="external" href="#">Prison Voicemail</a> service.</p>

          2. Email and social media
        </h1>


        <div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak direction-ltr disable-youtube">
          <p>Prisoners are not allowed to access social networking websites (such as Facebook or Twitter) while they’re in custody.</p>

          <p>You cannot email prisoners directly, but you can use a <a rel="external" href="#">service called Email a Prisoner</a>. If you send a message this way, it’ll be printed out and delivered by prison staff. Each email costs 40p and you need to buy credit to use the service.</p>

          <p>In some prisons, prisoners can also reply and attach a photo through Email a Prisoner. <a rel="external" href="#">Check which prisons allow replies</a>.</p>

          <p>You can send money to someone in prison by making an <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">online payment by Visa, Mastercard and Maestro debit card</a>.</p>

          <p>You may be able to <a rel="external" href="{{ SEND_MONEY_URL }}/help/apply-for-exemption/">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>
